Source: http://clarivate.com

At the center of Web of Science Core Collection are three flagship Citation Indexes, namely, the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and the Arts & Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). These Citation Indexes cover the world’s top tier international and regional journals whose evaluation and selection is governed by the Web of Science Core Collection Journal Selection Process, a well-established set of criteria that have been applied consistently for over fifty years. Citation impact is one of the defining characteristics of journals covered in SCIE and SSCI. Measurable citation impact, as expressed in the Journal Impact Factor, is published annually for journals covered in SCIE and SSCI.

Emerging Sources Citation Index is a new edition in Web of Science Core Collection. ESCI is a multidisciplinary Citation Index covering all areas of the scholarly literature of the sciences, social sciences and arts & humanities. The Core Collection Journal Selection Process now includes a set of fundamental criteria that govern the selection of Journals for ESCI. The selection process for ESCI is related to the process applied to SCIE, SSCI and AHCI. Journals accepted for coverage in ESCI must be peer reviewed, follow ethical publishing practices, meet our technical requirements, have English language bibliographic information, and be recommended or requested by a scholarly audience of Web of Science users.
While some journals under evaluation are selected directly into one or more of the flagship Citation Indexes (SCIE, SSCI, AHCI) many other eligible journals will be covered initially in ESCI. Journals covered initially in ESCI may be evaluated later for coverage in SCIE, SSCI or AHCI. Coverage in ESCI, however, does not guarantee eventual acceptance into SCIE, SSCI or AHCI. Indeed, some journals that need to be deselected from coverage in SCIE, SSCI or AHCI may migrate to coverage in ESCI.

It is important to note here that coverage of journals included in ESCI is never duplicated in SCIE, SSCI or AHCI. Coverage in ESCI is entirely separate from coverage in one or more of the Core Collection flagship indexes (SCIE, SSCI, AHCI).

In addition, we do not calculate Journal Impact Factor metrics for journals covered in ESCI. Only journals that are selected for SCIE and SSCI will be listed in the Journal Citation Reports with Journal Impact Factor and related metrics. The data underlying the metrics are drawn from the Citation Indexes that comprise the Web of Science Core Collection: SCIE, SSCI, AHCI, ESCI, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI). (Journal Impact Factors are not calculated for journals covered solely in AHCI.)

Because ESCI is a true Citation Index it is possible for users to track citation activity at the article and publication levels. Moreover, the citation activity for journals covered in ESCI will be used in the Journal Selection Process for SCIE, SSCI and AHCI and will enhance the transparency of that aspect of the Process. We will not, however, publish an official Impact Factor for publications covered in ESCI. Impact Factors are published annually in the Journal Citation Reports for SCIE and SSCI journals exclusively.

The Web of Science Core Collection Journal Selection Process now includes those criteria that Editorial Development applies to journals evaluated and selected (or rejected) for the ESCI. The Journal Selection Process for the central focus of Core Collection, namely, SCIE, SSCI and AHCI, remains fundamentally unchanged and consistent. SCIE, SSCI and AHCI continue to define the highly selective and central focus of Core Collection.

May be it will be useful for all of us.

Thanks.

4/19/18, 11:54 - ‪+91 95788 33000‬: Difference between SCI, SCIE, ESCI, Web of Science
Source: http://clarivate.com

At the center of Web of Science Core Collection are three flagship Citation Indexes, namely, the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and the Arts & Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). These Citation Indexes cover the world’s top tier international and regional journals whose evaluation and selection is governed by the Web of Science Core Collection Journal Selection Process, a well-established set of criteria that have been applied consistently for over fifty years. Citation impact is one of the defining characteristics of journals covered in SCIE and SSCI. Measurable citation impact, as expressed in the Journal Impact Factor, is published annually for journals covered in SCIE and SSCI.

Emerging Sources Citation Index is a new edition in Web of Science Core Collection. ESCI is a multidisciplinary Citation Index covering all areas of the scholarly literature of the sciences, social sciences and arts & humanities. The Core Collection Journal Selection Process now includes a set of fundamental criteria that govern the selection of Journals for ESCI. The selection process for ESCI is related to the process applied to SCIE, SSCI and AHCI. Journals accepted for coverage in ESCI must be peer reviewed, follow ethical publishing practices, meet our technical requirements, have English language bibliographic information, and be recommended or requested by a scholarly audience of Web of Science users.
While some journals under evaluation are selected directly into one or more of the flagship Citation Indexes (SCIE, SSCI, AHCI) many other eligible journals will be covered initially in ESCI. Journals covered initially in ESCI may be evaluated later for coverage in SCIE, SSCI or AHCI. Coverage in ESCI, however, does not guarantee eventual acceptance into SCIE, SSCI or AHCI. Indeed, some journals that need to be deselected from coverage in SCIE, SSCI or AHCI may migrate to coverage in ESCI.

It is important to note here that coverage of journals included in ESCI is never duplicated in SCIE, SSCI or AHCI. Coverage in ESCI is entirely separate from coverage in one or more of the Core Collection flagship indexes (SCIE, SSCI, AHCI).

In addition, we do not calculate Journal Impact Factor metrics for journals covered in ESCI. Only journals that are selected for SCIE and SSCI will be listed in the Journal Citation Reports with Journal Impact Factor and related metrics. The data underlying the metrics are drawn from the Citation Indexes that comprise the Web of Science Core Collection: SCIE, SSCI, AHCI, ESCI, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI). (Journal Impact Factors are not calculated for journals covered solely in AHCI.)

Because ESCI is a true Citation Index it is possible for users to track citation activity at the article and publication levels. Moreover, the citation activity for journals covered in ESCI will be used in the Journal Selection Process for SCIE, SSCI and AHCI and will enhance the transparency of that aspect of the Process. We will not, however, publish an official Impact Factor for publications covered in ESCI. Impact Factors are published annually in the Journal Citation Reports for SCIE and SSCI journals exclusively.

The Web of Science Core Collection Journal Selection Process now includes those criteria that Editorial Development applies to journals evaluated and selected (or rejected) for the ESCI. The Journal Selection Process for the central focus of Core Collection, namely, SCIE, SSCI and AHCI, remains fundamentally unchanged and consistent. SCIE, SSCI and AHCI continue to define the highly selective and central focus of Core Collection.

May be it will be useful for all of us. Thanks.

Worth reading on ...


1. Intelligence leads to arguments.
Wisdom leads to settlements.
2. Intelligence is power of will.
Wisdom is power OVER  will.
3. Intelligence is heat, it burns.
Wisdom is warmth, it comforts.
4. Intelligence is pursuit of knowledge, it tires the seeker.
Wisdom is pursuit of truth, it inspires the seeker.
5. Intelligence is holding on.
Wisdom is letting go.
6. Intelligence leads you.
Wisdom guides you.
7. An intelligent man thinks he knows everything.
A wise man knows that there is still something to learn.
8. An intelligent man always tries to prove his point.
A wise man knows there really is no point.
9. An intelligent man freely gives unsolicited advice.
A wise man keeps his counsel until all options are considered.
10. An intelligent man understands what is being said.
A wise man understands what is left unsaid.
11. An intelligent man speaks when he has to say something.
A wise man speaks when he has something to say.
12. An intelligent man sees  everything as relative.
A wise man sees everything as related.
13. An intelligent man tries to control the mass flow.
A wise man navigates the mass flow.
14. An intelligent man preaches.
A wise man reaches.

Intelligence is good
but wisdom is better.
